## Abstract
Snapshot hyperspectral imaging has been developed to capture the spectral information of dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network by learning the tensor low-rank prior of hyperspectral images (HSI) in the feature domain to promote the reconstruction quality. Our method is inspired by the canonical-polyadic (CP) decomposition theory, where a low-rank tensor can be expressed as a weight summation of several rank-1 component tensors. Specifically, we first learn the tensor low-rank prior of the image features with two steps: (a) we generate rank-1 tensors with discriminative components to collect the contextual information from both spatial and channel dimensions of the image features; (b) we aggregate those rank-1 tensors into a low-rank tensor as a 3D attention map to exploit the global correlation and refine the image features. Then, we integrate the learned tensor low-rank prior into an iterative optimization algorithm to obtain an end-to-end HSI reconstruction. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of our method.

## Data
We provide data of two datasets (*Harvard and ICVL*) for training and testing. It can be download from [Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DJ8VVzrSZ73K1C3D1hsNKnWHmNH5sgMt?usp=sharing). 

The resolution of testing data provided here is $512 \times 512 \times 31$. Note that, for the comparison with previous methods, we evaluate the results of the central areas with $256 \times 256 \times 31$ in the paper.
